What is Xively data stream?

    Xively (formerly Cosm and Pachube) is an Internet of Things (IoT) platform from Google. 
    Xively offers product companies a way to connect products, 
    manage the connected devices and the data they produce,
    and integrate this data with other systems. Pronounced zively (living rhymes).

What’s the difference between a Xively data feed and a channel?

    A channel generally refers to a physical construct or virtual path through which something is sent.
    The channel determines how the data is sent. Stream is the specific data that is sent over a channel.

What is the difference between Xively data stream and a channel? 

Xively device: 
    It is your “device” or the IoT project you are building. 
    Consider it as an envelope containing the data. 
    Channels: It is the streaming coming from your sensors. 
    Usually, the channel number is equal to the sensor number (as long as you want to monitor them all).
